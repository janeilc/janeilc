    <p id="intro">Hi, my name is Janeil and I am a student at Kennesaw State University. I am mostly interested in the Cybersecurity field, but I am also keen on learning to code. One of the main reasons why I wanted to further my education is because more women should take an interest in the STEM field. STEM is a highly male-dominated industry, so the perspectives of research and ideas are partial. Introducing women to these fields can result in greater diversity in not only perspectives but also the workforce</p>
